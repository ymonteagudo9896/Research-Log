I found this web page from ***datapine*** on the “[General Overviews of Analytic Reports](https://www.datapine.com/blog/analytical-report-example-and-template/)”. It explains what an Analytical Reports is and how companies use it to gather quantitive and qualitive data to evaluate the business process. I will also give you different tools on how to write an Analytical Report and some visual examples so you can see what information is collected and how it is processed.
