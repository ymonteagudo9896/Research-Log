# Research Log WEEK 4/5
________________________________________
Begin by offering a recap of what you did this week and what you think you learned by engaging the course work. Think of this as the 2-sentence summary of your research log.
________________________________________
Your personal learning outcomes...we want to revisit these each week. Did you progress towards accomplishing any of these personal outcomes? (or, have your sense of your personal outcomes shifted or changed at all now that we are a little further into the quarter? If this seems like a repeat of what you already said in your research log, approach it this way -- rate your performance in relation to a personal outcome on scale of 1 - 5. Explain your rationale for this rating.

Much of what will we do in class will work toward multiple course outcomes and meeting outcomes is an ongoing process. Over the past two weeks, our current project -- writing and analytically report for PierceHacker -- hits on a variety of them, including;

---

### Outcome #1
Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences.

* Gathering the appropriate information is very important for anyone in the world of technical writing. If we can provide the correct information to our audience, they will not be able to complete the task they need to do. Giving them a simplistic but informative set of instruction, anything can be accomplished. If you don’t have accurate information you won’t be able to create an accurate report

### Outcome #6
Complete a collaborative team report. Not everyone is collaborating at this stage, but some are. Additionally, I've suggested that even if we're not collaborating in one sense of the term, we are ideally working in cooperation with others.

* Even if we’re not in a collaborating stage I have collaborated with different people in class. I have helped by showing how to create a file to store images on GitHub and how to add those images to a markdown file.

### Outcome #2
Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately.

* As time has gone by, I have learned a great deal on how to create a user-friendly technical manual, and how to use GitHub to create markdowns that will be used online. This will defiantly help me accomplish my goals in the future.
    
### Outcome #4
Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.

* it’s very important to use graphics that are easy to see and related to set of instruction you are creating. Graphics can make or break a technical manual. Many people don’t even read the instruction part, they just look at the pictures to complete the task. Many technical manuals don’t use works but just pictures so it is very important to have graphics that can be understood by anyone looking at it.

How would you rate -- on a scale of 1 - 5 or even using a letter grade system -- your progress in meeting these outcomes? 

* I feel that I meet a scale of 4. 

What's your rationale for this rating?

* I collaborated/helped a few of my classmates on how to use GitHub and how to add pictures to their reports. I helped create a few questions on our survey to help better understand what I wanted to know from pierce college students. 

What do you think would be some good next steps for you in working toward meeting these outcomes?

* So far, I feel comfortable with my outcomes, I just need to continue to help my classmates and stay focused.
