# Research Log WEEK 4/5

---
* Begin by offering a recap of what you did this week and what you think you learned by engaging the course work. Think of this as the 2 sentence summary of your research log.

---
Your personal learning outcomes...we want to revisit these each week. Did you progress towards accomplishing any of these personal outcomes? (or, have your sense of your personal outcomes shifted or changed at all now that we are a little further into the quarter? If this seems like a repeat of what you already said in your research log, approach it this way -- rate your performance in relation to a personal outcome on scale of 1 - 5. Explain your rationale for this rating.

Much of what will we do in class will work toward multiple course outcomes and meeting outcomes is an ongoing process. Over the past two weeks, our current project -- writing and analytically report for PierceHacker -- hits on a variety of them, including;

### Outcome #1
Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences.

### Outcome #6 
Complete a collaborative team report. Not everyone is collaborating at this stage, but some are. Additionally, I've suggested that even if we're not collaborating in one sense of the term, we are ideally working in cooperation with others.

### Outcome #2
Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately.

### Outcome #4
Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.


How would you rate -- on a scale of 1 - 5 or even using a letter grade system -- your progress in meeting these outcomes? What's your rationale for this rating?

What do you think would be some good next steps for you in working toward meeting these outcomes?
