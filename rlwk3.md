Begin by offering a recap of what you did this week and what you think you learned by engaging the course work. Think of this as the 2 sentence summary of your research log.

----
Your personal learning outcomes...we want to revisit these each week. Did you progress towards accomplishing any of these personal outcomes? (Or, have your sense of your personal outcomes shifted or changed at all now that we are a little further into the quarter? If this seems like a repeat of what you already said in your research log, approach it this way -- rate your performance in relation to a personal outcome on scale of 1 - 5. Explain your rationale for this rating.


Much of what will we do in class will work toward multiple course outcomes and meeting outcomes is an ongoing process. This week at least 3 outcomes seem are in the mix and in-progress:


#### Outcome #1
Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences (Ex: resume, claim letter, instructions assignment, investigative report, proposal, feasibility report). The first phase of the PierceHacker project is an attempt identify gather some information in the process of writing a variety of report.

1. I feel that the main reason to gather information is so we can get a better understanding of how people use different things in their everyday life or just get a better understanding of something or person. Or to make improvements to something. Like with a resume the future employer can see if that person is a good fit for the position they applied for, without wasting anyone's time. So creating a survey will help us learn more about the students here at Pierce College and what tutorials they would like to use to better help them in school.


#### Outcome #6
Complete a collaborative team report. The word "report" in our outcomes is used to cover a wide variety of texts, including even something like a survey. Our work in still progress, but how would rate (or grade) your work as collaborator this week? Why would you give yourself this assessment?
1. Honestly I feel that I can give our work a B because it’s not completely done yet. We had to make a few changes so everything would look professional and people would understand what question being asked.


#### Outcome #2
Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately. At this point in the quarter how would you rate (or grade) you’re meeting of this outcome? What's your rationale for this rating?
1. I can say that I’d give myself a B. From the moment I started class until now I have learned a great deal of information and gained more knowledge on the world of technical writing. As the days go by I feel more and more comfortable with the class tasks that are given and enjoy completing them. I’m still learning on different aspects of the class and I have made some mistakes but I hop that I can continue to learn mo0re as time goes by.




What do you think would be some good next steps in working toward meeting these outcomes? What are you looking forward to in the coming week(s)?

Finally, what can I as an instructor do to better support you and your work?
