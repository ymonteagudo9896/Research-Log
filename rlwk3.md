Begin by offering a recap of what you did this week and what you think you learned by engaging the course work. Think of this as the 2 sentence summary of your research log.
 ---
Your personal learning outcomes...we want to revisit these each week. Did you progress towards accomplishing any of these personal outcomes? (or, have your sense of your personal outcomes shifted or changed at all now that we are a little further into the quarter? If this seems like a repeat of what you already said in your research log, approach it this way -- rate your performance in relation to a personal outcome on scale of 1 - 5. Explain your rationale for this rating.


Much of what will we do in class will work toward multiple course outcomes and meeting outcomes is an ongoing process. This week at least 3 outcomes seem are in the mix and in-progress:


#### Outcome #1
Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences (Ex: resume, claim letter, instructions assignment, investigative report, proposal, feasibility report). The first phase of the PierceHacker project is an attempt identify gather some information in the process of writing a variety of report.


#### Outcome #6
Complete a collaborative team report. The word "report" in our outcomes is used to cover a wide variety of texts, including even something like a survey. Our work in still progress, but how would rate (or grade) your work as collaborator this week? Why would you give yourself this assessment?


#### Outcome 2
Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately. At this point in the quarter how would you rate (or grade) your meeting of this outcome? What's your rationale for this rating?



What do you think would be some good next steps in working toward meeting these outcomes? What are you looking forward to in the coming week(s)?

Finally, what can I as an instructor do to better support you and your work?
