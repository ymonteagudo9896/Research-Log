# Research Log WEEK 6/7

Over the past two weeks our work has been focused on the PierceHacker project.

As always, I am interested in you attempting to articulate what you think you learned this week. These things could be big or small. It could be a new insight or maybe even a reminder of a skill that you already had but maybe hadn't put to use in a while.
Turning to our course objectives, my sense is that these course objectives are at the heart of this work: 

### Outcome #1
Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences.

* It was important to know what where the needs of the college students at Pierce College so we could write the appropriate tutorials. That way we didn’t do anything that wasn’t completely needed, and answered the common issues some of the students have.

### Outcome #2
Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately.

* As a student in Eng. 235 I didn’t know how to create a twitter bot. That thought made me think that I wasn’t the only one. I had some resources provide from my professor that pointed me in the right direction. From the research I did I saw that not everyone will have the skills to code a bot, so I use a format that already existed but gave it more detail on how to create a bot.

### Outcome #4
Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.

* I created a twitter account so I could use up-to-date pictures because Zack’s spreadsheet had pictures from older versions of twitter and to me it was a little confusing. Having current graphs will help the reader understand what they’re looking at. 

### Outcome #6
Complete a collaborative team report. Not everyone is collaborating at this stage, but some are. Additionally, I've suggested that even if we're not collaborating in one sense of the term, we are ideally working in cooperation with others.

* I collaborated with the pierce hacker team in creating a tutorial. I also help some of my other classmates by helping them with some issues they were having with the markdown format because some of their pictures were not showing.

#### In working with PierceHacker, we gathered survey data, analyzed it and attempted to use it to produce materials for the project site aimed at specific audiences of students within the Pierce community.

How would you assess your performance in this area? What have you learned about the work of using a survey to collect data? About what it might mean to analyze and put that data to use? 

* being able to know what my “audience” is looking for helped me look for the needed information to be able to create a good and helpful tutorial.

How would you assess your performance in terms of contributing to project like PierceHacker? Where you able to tap into the purpose of the project and tailor your work to support this purpose? Where you able to apply a sense of audience in the development of your contributions to the project? 

* I was able to completely able to tap into the purpose of the project. This being my first time creating a bot I felt that I knew what questions the read might be asking. That helped me being detailed with my tutorial.

#### Our work over the last two weeks has asked you to utilize GitHub and Markdown in developing your work as well as using other potential tools (Google drive, etc.) in collaborating with your colleagues.

We might define information competency not as having mastered a tool -- competency is different from expertise -- but instead as the ability to successfully navigate the challenges of using both familiar and unfamiliar tools in new contexts. How would you assess your own information competency? How well were you able to work with unfamiliar information technology?

* I have never used or even heard of GitHub before this class. The first few days I had no idea what I was doing and I even had to redo my read me file a few times. But as time went on, I learned how to navigate GitHub, create files, create a repository, and even some markdown codes. I also found some tools to help me create a markdown file like Markdown Pad. 

### Outcome #4
Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.

Lots of need for working with graphics (images, charts, etc.) in this project work.

How'd it go? What for you is the biggest challenge in working with graphics/visual material? How'd you navigate this challenge?

* At first, I didn’t know how add pictures to my markdown files but after doing some research I was able to find to correct procedure and it wasn’t an issue.

### Outcome #6
Complete a collaborative team report. 

So, this is maybe the big one. Collaboration.

Describe your group's collaborative process? How was labor shared? How was it divided up? Did your group have a leader, or utilize a sense of roles within the group? What was your rationale for the process?

* It was a large group process and we all communicated very well. The work we did was divided up to where all I had to focused on was creating my tutorial. I did help remove some of the pressure on me. I didn’t feel we had a group leader but everyone did have a specific role that they did for the group. Everyone had a crucial role in the pierce hacker project because we want to project to succeed. 

Identify at least one thing that you felt worked well in your collaboration. Describe how you will accentuate that element in your next collaborative situation.

* We all communicated very well, and didn’t criticize someone for making a simple mistake. That is a very key element when collaborating because it will keep everyone motivated and on target. 

Identify at least one thing that you would do differently in your next collaborative project. What strategy might you use next time to help avoid or better navigate what didn't work?

* I think that we could have sat down to create an internal survey to make sure that the tutorials that each individual wanted to create would be a benefit to pierce college students. Doing that will help us focused on more specific goals to accomplish.

>Note: In the language of the outcomes, "report" is a term used to cover a variety of texts/genres. On another note, the English department is in the process of revising outcomes, in part because of oddities like using the term "report" to cover everything.
