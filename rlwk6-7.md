# Research Log WEEK 6/7

Over the past two weeks our work has been focused on the PierceHacker project.
As always, I am interested in you attempting to articulate what you think you learned this week. These things could be big or small. It could be a new insight or maybe even a reminder of a skill that you already had but maybe hadn't put to use in a while.
Turning to our course objectives, my sense is that these course objectives are at the heart of this work: 

### Outcome #1
Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences.

### Outcome #2
Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately.

### Outcome #4
Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.

### Outcome #6
Complete a collaborative team report. Not everyone is collaborating at this stage, but some are. Additionally, I've suggested that even if we're not collaborating in one sense of the term, we are ideally working in cooperation with others.

In working with PierceHacker, we gathered survey data, analyzed it and attempted to use it to produce materials for the project site aimed at specific audiences of students within the Pierce community.

* How would you assess your performance in this area? What have you learned about the work of using a survey to collect data? About what it might mean to analyze and put that data to use? 

* How would you assess your performance in terms of contributing to project like PierceHacker? Where you able to tap into the purpose of the project and tailor your work to support this purpose? Where you able to apply a sense of audience in the development of your contributions to the project? 

Our work over the last two weeks has asked you to utilize GitHub and Markdown in developing your work as well as using other potential tools (Google drive, etc.) in collaborating with your collegues.

* We might define information competency not as having mastered a tool -- competency is different from expertise -- but instead as the ability to successfully navigate the challenges of using both familiar and unfamiliar tools in new contexts. How would you assess your own information competency? How well were you able to work with unfamiliar infomation technology?

### Outcome #4
Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.

Lots of need for working with graphics (images, charts, etc.) in this project work.

* How'd it go? What for you is the biggest challenge in working with graphics/visual material? How'd you navigate this challenge?

### Outcome #6
Complete a collaborative team report. 

So this is maybe the big one. Collaboration.

* Describe your group's collaborative process? How was labor shared? How was it divided up? Did your group have a leader, or utilize a sense of roles within the group? What was your rationale for the process?

* Identify at least one thing that you felt worked well in your collaboration. Describe how you will accentuate that element in your next collaborative situation.

* Identify at least one thing that you would do differently in your next collaborative project. What strategy might you use next time to help avoid or better navigate what didn't work?

>Note: In the language of the outcomes, "report" is  a term used to cover a variety of texts/genres. On another note, the English department is in the process of revising outcomes, in part because of oddities like using the term "report" to cover everything.
