# Research Log WEEK 2

## **Creating a Lego instruction manual** ##

This week I learned how to create a technical manual on how to build a Lego toy that I created. I was a very intresting project because I had to make sure that i didnt over complicate my instructions, but simple enough that you could rebuild it just by looking at the pictures.

#**Week 2 Self-Evaluation**
--
Begin by offering a recap of what you did this week and what you think you learned by engaging the course work.

* This week we finished our ***LEGO*** mini project and had another person reassemble it by reading the instruction manual I created. The feed back that i got was that i should have explained better when the instruction was transitioning from one assembled part to another because at one point it was unclear that the LEGO was being built in sections. 

Last week I asked you to list 3 - 5 personal learning outcomes that you think you have for the course. Revisit those this week. Did you progress towards accomplishing any of these personal outcomes? Have your sense of your personal outcomes shifted or changed at all now that we are a little further into the quarter?

Much of what will we do in class will work toward multiple course outcomes and meeting outcomes is an ongoing process. I think two outcomes in particular were relevant this week -- Outcome #3 ("Transform instructions") and Outcome 2 ("Information competency"). This week we made instructions sets. For the past two weeks you've been learning to use new pieces of "information technology" GitHub and write with Markdown -- which is a process of developing information competency. How do you think you are progressing towards these two outcomes?

Beyond the two outcomes I identify above, you might recognize some progress in another outcome or area. If so, also describe that progress. Looking back over the week, what elements of the work did you find most challenging? Where in your work this week did you find yourself most successful?

Learning is a social, communal process. Who did you work with this week both in and outside of class? Whom helped you this week in your work for this course? Whom did you help? This includes offering feedback and other support. This also includes things like going to the Writing Center to discuss ideas and projects.

What are you looking forward to in the coming week(s)?

Finally, what can I as an instructor do to better support you and your work?

**Course Outcomes**
--
1. Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences (Ex: resume, claim letter, instructions assignment, investigative report, proposal, feasibility report).

2. Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately.

3. Transform instructions into informational units set down in a numbered sequence that is in logical order, in both writing and illustrations.

4. Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.

5. Write at least three different analytical reports implementing the appropriate content and format for each.

6. Complete a collaborative team report.

7. Identify and articulate ethical and multicultural issues in technical writing.
