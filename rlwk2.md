## Week 2 Self-Evaluation

Begin by offering a recap of what you did this week and what you think you learned by engaging the course work.

*	This week we finished our **LEGO** mini project and had another person reassemble it by reading the instruction manual I created. The feedback that I got was that I should have explained better when the instruction was transitioning from one assembled part to another because at one point it was unclear that the LEGO was being built in sections.

Last week I asked you to list 3 - 5 personal learning outcomes that you think you have for the course. Revisit those this week. Did you progress towards accomplishing any of these personal outcomes? Have your sense of your personal outcomes shifted or changed at all now that we are a little further into the quarter?

*	So far I have learned more on how to use GitHub. I also found useful tools on how to better use GitHub. I hope to continue to learn more as I go deeper in the class.

*	I also learned more on what it takes to be a technical writer and the proper steps on writing a technical manual.

Much of what will we do in class will work toward multiple course outcomes and meeting outcomes is an ongoing process. I think two outcomes in particular were relevant this week -- Outcome #3 ("Transform instructions") and Outcome 2 ("Information competency"). This week we made instructions sets. For the past two weeks you've been learning to use new pieces of "information technology" GitHub and write with Markdown -- which is a process of developing information competency. How do you think you are progressing towards these two outcomes?

*	I was able to put my prototype into words in a way that someone else could reassemble my project with no assistance. As time goes by I hope I can be more proficient in my technical writing.

*	I feel like I am progressing very well in learning GitHub and finding the short cuts and different markdown tools I can use with GitHub.

Beyond the two outcomes I identify above, you might recognize some progress in another outcome or area. If so, also describe that progress. Looking back over the week, what elements of the work did you find most challenging? Where in your work this week did you find yourself most successful?

*	We’re currently working creating a survey to gather some information from different students at Pierce College to find out what type of programs they use to store their school work. This will also help me with how to create a user friendly survey.

Learning is a social, communal process. Who did you work with this week both in and outside of class? Whom helped you this week in your work for this course? Whom did you help? This includes offering feedback and other support. This also includes things like going to the Writing Center to discuss ideas and projects.

*	I worked with Sam and showed him how to create a web link and how to rename it to something else. 
*	I shared the “markdown pad” tool that I found online, which has helped me learn more on how to use GitHub.
What are you looking forward to in the coming week(s)?
*	I hope to learn more about Pierce Hacker and be able to provide a good tutorial in something someone can use to make their school life easier.
Finally, what can I as an instructor do to better support you and your work?
*	I still feel the same as I did last week. I’m learning a lot from this class and enjoy the environment I’m in.
