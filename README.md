# Research-Log
Introduce yourself. My name is Yamill Monteagudo, I am an Army veteran. I did 8 years active service and 2 Iraq#bold tours. I got out of the Army in 2006 and I was then hired to work over seas in Afghanistan for 6 years.
Describe your own initial understandings and assumptions about “technical writing” as you start the course. How do your initial understandings/assumptions align (or not) with the readings we have done this week?
Describe and reflect on your work in setting up an account and repository on GitHub. The “Hello World” tutorial/guide on GitHub is an example of tech writing. What did you notice about it? What seem to be this sort of texts key characterisics and features?
The Programming Historian and PierceHacker are perhaps many things, but they are I believe technical writing projects at their core. Our reading “The Rhetorical Nature of Technical and Professional Writing” frames tech writing as fundementally rhetorical. This means that questions of purpose, audience, and medium of delivery are fundemental to the work of technical writing. Consider – who is the particular audience for The Programming Historian? For Pierce Hacker? What is the purpose of The Programming Historian? Of PierceHacker? Why do you think the writers/designers of these projects decided to deliver their work via the medium of a public website?
Finally, as best you can, try to articulate what you feel you’ve learned this week?
